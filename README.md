# Secure Shell (SSH) Configuration – Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Secure Shell (SSH) on Cisco network
devices to provide secure remote management access and replace insecure protocols
such as Telnet.

The lab focuses on applying basic security hardening practices for network device access.

- Cisco IOS
- Secure Shell (SSH)
- RSA Encryption
- Local User Authentication
- TCP/IP

---

## Configuration Summary
- Device hostname and domain name configuration
- RSA key generation for SSH
- Local user account creation
- SSH version 2 enabled
- VTY lines configured for SSH-only access
- Telnet disabled

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- Secure remote device management
- Difference between SSH and Telnet
- Authentication using local user database
- VTY line security
- Basic network device hardening

---

## Verification
- Successful SSH access from management PC
- Telnet access blocked
